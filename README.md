# Lean 4 Game

This is a prototype for a Lean 4 game platform. It is based on ideas from the [Lean Game Maker](https://github.com/mpedramfar/Lean-game-maker) and the [Natural Number Game
(NNG)](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/)
of Kevin Buzzard and Mohammad Pedramfar. 
The project is currently mostly copied from Patrick Massot's [NNG4](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/NNG4), but we plan to extend it significantly.

Building this requires a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) toolchain. After cloning the repository you should run
`npm install` to pull in all dependencies. For development and experimentation, you can run `npm start` that will perform a non-optimized build and then run a local webserver on port 3000.
